## Some examples based on SEED Network Security Labs

These examples may not be strictly based on the content of the lab descriptions. I have implemented some interesting programs based on the topics.

Some custom examples:

 - [ifconfig-clone](SniffSpoof/pcap-examples/getdeviceorig.c)
 - traceroute clone: Run [this script](SniffSpoof/scapy-examples/traceroute_sniff.py) (Change the IP Address `10.0.2.15` to your local IP) first and then [this script](SniffSpoof/scapy-examples/traceroute.py)
